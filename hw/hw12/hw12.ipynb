    "What we've done so far in this class is called Simple Linear Regression (SLR), which involves one attribute to estimate a single numerical outcome. Precisely, the equation for the regression line has the following form: $$y = \\text{slope} \\cdot x+\\text{intercept}$$ Here, $x$ is the attribute, and we predict the value of $y$ by applying a slope and adding an intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will extend this idea to Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), which uses multiple attributes instead of just one. We make the prediction by multiplying each attribute value by its corresponding slope and summing them all together. The equation for the regression line has the following form: $$y = \\text{slope}_1 \\cdot x_1 + \\text{slope}_2 \\cdot x_2+ ... +\\text{slope}_k \\cdot x_k$$ for $k$ predictor variables. Here, $x_1$, $x_2$, $\\cdots$, $x_k$ represent different numerical predictor variables from the dataset, and we still predict a single numerical output $y$. Each predictor variable gets its own slope. Note that in this homework, our equation for the regression line will not have an intercept, but in general, the equation for the regression line can have an intercept!\n",
    "\n",
    "We use MLR when we believe more than one attribute influences the outcome we are trying to predict. To build the model, we split the dataset into a training set and a testing set. We use the training set to find the best slopes, and then evaluate its performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the testing set.\n",

To make a prediction, we first calculate the Euclidean distance between the point we are trying to predict and each point in the data set. We then find the k closest points, known as the nearest neighbors. Instead of taking a majority vote like we did in kNN classificaiton, we take the average of the values we are trying to predict from the nearest neighbors.

After all, the deeper the shot lands, the more pressure you put on the opponent! This is where kNN regression is useful \u2014 rather than labeling the bounce location, we can use it to predict the depth (numerical position) where the ball is likely to bounce."
